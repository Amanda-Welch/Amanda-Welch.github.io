        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>In 2019 I took a short Web Design course to see if I'd enjoy it, and I worked with a real client's website in the end. It was good for a first time. The site is not up but my code is on GitHub.</p>
        <p>In 2022 I built another website for a school project. It was supposed to be for 'my own web design company' business. I don't know how long it will stay up on the school server but I hope you can check it out. <a class="btn-text-2" href="https://datcmedia.com/welcha/class-files/css-php/mod4/index.php" target="_blank">Version 1</a>, <a class="btn-text-2" href="https://datcmedia.com/welcha/html-css/" target="_blank">Version 2</a>, and <a class="btn-text-2" href="https://datcmedia.com/welcha/wordpress/" target="_blank">WordPress version</a>.</p>
        <p>I guess this website you are on right now is my third project!</p>
        <p>And I'm currently working on a fourth website for a cleaning company.</p>

In 2021, she accepted a job at Honest Eatery in Salt Lake City as a cook/FOH where she quickly became an Assistant Manager due to her eagerness to learn and attention to detail.
