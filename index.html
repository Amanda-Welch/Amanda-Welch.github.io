        <p>A great website helps you rank on SEO engines, makes you seem credible and approachable and will make you stand out among competitors. <br> But the BEST website is also easy to use and basically guides your client through the pages. A responsive, usable, and intuitive website impacts how your audience perceives your brand. Let's talk more about it, <a href="#block-4" class="btn-text">contact me.</a>

        <h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>
        <p>In 2019 I took a short Web Design course to see if I'd enjoy it, and I worked with a real client's website in the end. It was good for a first time. The site is not up but my code is on GitHub.</p>
        <p>In 2022 I built another website for a school project. It was supposed to be for 'my own web design company' business. I don't know how long it will stay up on the school server but I hope you can check it out. <a class="btn-text-2" href="https://datcmedia.com/welcha/class-files/css-php/mod4/index.php" target="_blank">Version 1</a>, <a class="btn-text-2" href="https://datcmedia.com/welcha/html-css/" target="_blank">Version 2</a>, and <a class="btn-text-2" href="https://datcmedia.com/welcha/wordpress/" target="_blank">WordPress version</a>.</p>
        <p>I guess this website you are on right now is my third project!</p>
        <p>And I'm currently working on a fourth website for a cleaning company.</p>

        <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
        <p>Amanda Welch graduated from the University of Sorocaba, in Brazil, in 2017 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Food and Nutrition. While in college, she earned a certificate in Gastronomy and worked as a nutrition intern taking care of each patient’s dietary needs at healthcare clinics and hospitals. And taking care of food safety and a team of cooks at a school kitchen and a big company’s industrial kitchen.
        In 2018 she moved to Utah. In 2019, she worked as an autonomous food and package deliverer, which taught her time management and to work without supervision. In 2021, she accepted a job at Honest Eatery in Salt Lake City as a cook/FOH where she quickly became an Assistant Manager due to her eagerness to learn and attention to detail. She is dedicated to the customer and passionate about creating a great experience that makes them come back. Amanda finds it incredibly motivating to use her behavior psychology interest to better her product/service. And she finds it inspiring to be part of a team made of unique minds working together in favor of making people’s day better. As a result of this experience, she gained skills in problem solving, handling money, leading a team and training new team members.
        In December 2022 she finished her Web and Graphic Design Certificate at Davis Technical College in Kaysville, Utah with 900 hours of experience in:
        <br/>
        Design Principles,
        HTML,
        CSS and SASS,
        PHP,
        WordPress,
        SEO,
        Debugging,
        JavaScript (jQuery),
        UX/UI,
        Adobe Photoshop,
        Adobe Illustrator,
        Adobe XD,
        Figma,
        InVision,
        Miro
        <br/>
        Always being creative and out-of-the-box thinker, she decided that a career in the web design industry would be exciting since it involves two of the topics she loves the most: tech and arts. Her hobbies include hiking, biking, playing video games, board games, and all music related activities.</p>
